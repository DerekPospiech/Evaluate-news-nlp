# Evaluate News With Natural Language Processing

Project Overview
------------

The goal of this Udacity project was to begin working with a Natural Language processing API and Webpack

According to the Udactiy Introduction:

"The goal of this project is to give you practice with:

Setting up Webpack
Sass styles
Webpack Loaders and Plugins
Creating layouts and page design
Service workers
Using APIs and creating requests to external urls"


Project Main Challenges
------------

* The app should make a successful call to the api on form submission. If this is successful, the api keys and response handling were done correctly. You can check that the api keys are found in server.js or a similar node file. It is not acceptable for an api key to be set in a client facing file (like index.js)

* Information from the api response must show up in the view. It is not enough for the response to be logged to the console or saved in js, etc..

* The project must have set up service workers in webpack.

*Both webpack config files must be present and should be set up similar to the course for development and production.

*A build script must run successfully with no errors and generate a dist folder. Bonus if they customized their npm build scripts.

*Students should also have a working dev mode, check that webpack dev server is set up and that they have an npm script that starts the server
